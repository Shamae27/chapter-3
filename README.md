# Learning Dart Basics

To learn Dart basics, start by understanding the fundamentals of variables and data types, including how to use var, constants, and nullable types. Practice control flow statements such as if-else, loops, and switch cases to build logical problem-solving skills. Next, explore functions by writing reusable code with parameters, default values, and return types. Dive into collections like lists, sets, and maps to manage and manipulate data effectively

Gradually, move on to object-oriented programming concepts, such as creating classes, objects, constructors, and using inheritance and encapsulation. Familiarize yourself with Dart's null safety features to avoid runtime errors, and then learn asynchronous programming using async, await, and Future for handling tasks like fetching data

Reinforce your learning by building small projects, such as a to-do app or a simple calculator, and refer to the official Dart documentation for additional support. Stay consistent and actively apply your knowledge to gain confidence in the language.
